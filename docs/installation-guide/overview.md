# HAlpha Installation Guide


What is HAlpha?
HAlpha is a specialized system that leverages the PMOD-WRC platform, located in Davos, for automated solar tracking and measurement. The system employs a high-resolution QHYCCD QHYCIII2000 camera mounted on a telescope to take detailed photos of the sun. These photos are then processed through custom algorithms to improve image quality, revealing the sun's intricate structures with enhanced clarity.

The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 as the central computing unit, connecting to the QHYCCD camera via USB. This setup not only captures the solar images but also processes them in real-time, applying sophisticated image enhancement techniques to bring out the finest details of the sun's surface and atmosphere.

Who is HAlpha For?
HAlpha is designed for astronomers, researchers, and solar observation enthusiasts who are interested in high-quality solar imaging. Whether you are a professional maintaining the setup or an amateur wishing to replicate this setup for personal or educational use, HAlpha offers a comprehensive guide to achieving exceptional solar images.

Why HAlpha?
The sun is a dynamic and complex star, with surface activities that provide valuable insights into solar phenomena. Traditional solar imaging methods can fall short in capturing the subtle details of the sun's surface. HAlpha addresses this challenge by:

Automated Solar Tracking: Utilizing the PMOD-WRC platform for precise and automated tracking of the sun, ensuring that high-quality images are captured throughout the day without manual intervention.
Advanced Image Processing: Employing custom algorithms to significantly enhance the image quality, making the sun's structure more visible and detailed.
Continuous Observation: With the capability to take a photo every minute, HAlpha facilitates continuous monitoring of the sun, allowing for the observation of transient solar events and long-term changes in solar activity.
Ease of Access: The processed images are automatically sent to an external drive using Samba SMBClient, ensuring that the data is easily accessible for analysis, sharing, and archiving.
