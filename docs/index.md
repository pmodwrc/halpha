This site contains the project documentation for the
**Solar Imaging in Halpha** project that is a project realised from civil service employees at the PMOD/WRC in Davos, Switzerland.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of five separate parts:

1. [Overview](overview.md)
2. [Installation Guide](installation.md)
3. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides/how-to-guide-livestream.md)
4. [Reference](reference/cameracontrol.md)
5. [Hardware](hardware.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.

I want to thank my house plants for providing me with
a negligible amount of oxygen each day. Also, I want
to thank the sun for providing more than half of their
nourishment free of charge.
